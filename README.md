# buildingalinuxkernel <br>
Downloaded a linux kernel source code and then modified the config file to get it ready for compilation <br>
In certain situations the use of manually creating a kernel will be useful such as when creating an embedded system which requires a customized version of the hardware. This is the case when we can build the kernel from scratch to the kind of models we need in our system. The kernel build for this was fedora and specially for fedora 37 and using linux 6.9 as the core rpm to build.
